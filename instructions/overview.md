Below is one possible roadmap for creating a text editor in Rust that simulates typewriter-like behavior. Each step outlines key tasks and considerations, along with multiple ways to implement particular features. There are also links to relevant crates and documentation.

---

## 1. Define Core Requirements

**Slower Text Reveal**  
- The editor should not display characters immediately.  
- A small delay (e.g., 0.5 seconds per character) helps mimic the physical slowness of a typewriter.  

**Non-destructive Backspace**  
- Instead of deleting text, backspace should mark text (e.g., with `x`) or move a cursor without erasing characters.  
- Then, when typing "x" it will “cross out” the next character(s).
- Multiple backspaces should be able to move back multiple characters, and then typing "x" will cross out a single character
- Instead of just changing the character to an x, we should use special ascii characters to make it look like the underlying character has been overwritten by x
  

**Progressive Obscuring of Older Text**  
- Recent lines remain visible, while older lines become blurred, shrunk, or hidden.  

**Formatting & Layout**  
- Option for a fixed page width, serif fonts, or typical typewriter fonts for a more authentic feel.  
- Traditional line breaks should function normally—hitting “enter” shouldn’t obscure all previous lines, only gradually reduce visibility.  

**Idle Timer**  
- If the user stops typing for a certain amount of time, the text can be covered until typing resumes.

## 2. Choose a User Interface Strategy

**Option A: Terminal-Based (TUI)**  
- Use crates like [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) or [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) to manage text, input, and screen drawing directly in the terminal.  
- Simpler to set up, though graphics (like a blur effect) might be approximated through ASCII or by gradually dimming colors.

**Option B: GUI Framework**  
- Consider [GTK-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/), [Azul](https://github.com/maps4print/azul), or [Druid](https://github.com/linebender/druid) for more control over typography, timing, and custom rendering.  
- Greater flexibility for visuals such as real-time partial blurring of text.

**Option C: Web-Based (WASM)**  
- Compile Rust to WebAssembly and build a web app where you can use CSS/JavaScript for animations (delay, blur, sizing).  
- Using [Yew](https://yew.rs/) or [Seed](https://seed-rs.org/) to manage state.

## 3. Set Up the Project Structure

1. Create a new Rust project:
   ```bash
   cargo new typewriter-editor
   ```
2. Decide on the UI approach (TUI, GUI, or Web).
3. Add relevant dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`. For example, if using `crossterm`:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   crossterm = "0.26"
   ```
4. Organize your source files:
   - `main.rs`: Entry point.
   - `editor.rs`: Core logic for editing, storing text, managing the buffer.
   - `ui.rs` or `tui.rs`: Rendering and event-handling code (if TUI).
   - `timer.rs`: Idle timer functionality, if you decide to keep that separate.

---

## 4. Implement Basic Text Capture

1. **Text Buffer**  
   - Store typed characters in a `Vec<char>` or a `String`.  
   - Include metadata for “removed” text, possibly a `Vec<String>` for entire words or phrases that have been marked out.  

2. **Key Event Handling**  
   - Capture keypress events using something like `crossterm::event::read()`.  
   - If the user presses a character key, append it to the buffer.  
   - If the user presses backspace, move the cursor backward or insert an `x` instead of removing characters.  
   - Keep track of line breaks (`\n`) for layout.

3. **Line-by-Line Updating**  
   - Render the last few lines of the buffer on the screen.  
   - Maintain an offset (like a simple scroll) if the buffer grows too large.

---

## 5. Add the Delayed Character Reveal

1. **Character Queue**  
   - When a user types a character, place it into a queue.  
   - A separate thread or a timer will take characters from this queue and append them to the visible buffer after a delay.

2. **Timing Mechanism**  
   - Use `std::time::Instant` or a library like [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) if you need async tasks.  
   - Sleep for a set interval (e.g., 500ms per character) before rendering.

3. **Rendering**  
   - On each render pass, only show those characters that have “matured” from the queue.  
   - This enforces the physical slower pace of typing.

---

## 6. Non-destructive Backspace

1. **Backspace Logic**  
   - Instead of removing the character from the buffer, move a “virtual cursor” left one position.  
   - Mark the character (for instance, by overwriting it with an `x` in a different color or style).  
   - Alternatively, store the “deleted” string in a separate collection.

2. **Separate Removed Text**  
   - Every time the user backspaces a word or phrase, store it in a list of “scrapped content.”  
   - Provide a command or shortcut to display those discarded lines/words in a different panel or area.

---

## 7. Obscuring Older Text

1. **Threshold for Recent vs Older Lines**  
   - Define a threshold (e.g., last two lines remain clear).  
   - Everything beyond that threshold becomes gradually faded or blurred.

2. **Implementation Ideas**  
   - If using a TUI, represent older text with dimmer ANSI colors, or replace characters with dots.  
   - If using a GUI, apply a partial transparency or blur effect in a separate canvas layer.  
   - Make sure scrolling or line breaks remain intuitive.

3. **Configurable Obscuring**  
   - Provide settings for how quickly text fades, the degree of blur or dimming, etc.

---

## 8. Handling Line Breaks

1. **Enter Key**  
   - On pressing enter, insert a `\n` in the buffer and move to the next line.  
   - Continue to display the new line without obscuring the immediate previous lines.  
   - Only lines that fall beyond the “recent lines” threshold get obscured.

2. **Layout**  
   - If you’re simulating a page layout, track characters per line, or let the text wrap automatically at a fixed width.  
   - For screenwriting or list-making, line breaks should stay visible for the necessary lines.

---

## 9. Introduce Idle Timer

1. **Timer Detection**  
   - Record the time at each character input.  
   - If no new input arrives within X seconds, display a cover layer on top of the text.

2. **Display Mechanism**  
   - In a TUI, you might replace the text with an ASCII overlay or a big block of text indicating “Paused.”  
   - In a GUI, render a semi-transparent rectangle covering everything.

3. **Resuming**  
   - As soon as a key is pressed again, remove the cover.  
   - This enforces forward momentum in drafting, preventing rereading.

## 10. Polishing and Formatting

1. **Font Choices**  
   - If using a terminal, you’re limited by the user’s font.  
   - If using a GUI, allow the user to pick a serif font (e.g., Times New Roman) or a typewriter-like font.  

2. **Page Size and Margins**  
   - Emulate a standard page width if desired.  
   - Ensure text wraps at the correct column for that page size.

3. **Configuration Files**  
   - Allow users to set the delay, obscure-threshold lines, idle timer intervals, font choices, etc.  
   - Store these in a simple `.toml` or `.yaml` config file.

---

## 11. Testing and Iteration

1. **Feature-by-Feature Testing**  
   - Ensure delayed typing, non-destructive backspace, and obscuring work correctly in isolation.  
   - Test on different OSes if cross-platform usage is planned.

2. **Edge Cases**  
   - Rapid keystrokes that outrun the reveal thread.  
   - Very large text input.  
   - Handling of special characters (tabs, unicode, etc.).

3. **Performance Optimization**  
   - If using concurrency or multiple threads, make sure there’s no significant input lag.  
   - Consider efficient data structures (e.g., rope data structure for large text editing).

---

## 12. Possible Enhancements

1. **Additional Editing Modes**  
   - Minimal “command mode” for advanced operations (search, jump to line, etc.).  
2. **Export/Import**  
   - Let users save the current buffer (including “removed” text) to a file.  
   - Provide functionality to load saved sessions.  
3. **Collaboration**  
   - Network-based approach for multiple users editing a typewriter-like document in real time.  
4. **Plugins or Scriptability**  
   - Provide a simple plugin system or script hooks for advanced customization.

This progression should help implement a Rust-based text editor that feels slower and more deliberate, similar to a manual typewriter. The interplay of delayed text reveal, non-destructive editing, and optional timers can improve the user’s focus on drafting and creative flow.
