Below is one possible technical specification for a command-line text editor implemented in Rust, designed to simulate the feel of a manual typewriter. Each section describes the requirements, architecture, data flow, and design decisions. References to potential Rust crates and libraries are included for context.

---

## 1. Overview

This CLI application captures keystrokes, adds a deliberate delay before displaying them, offers a non-destructive backspace mechanism, and provides optional text-obscuring features after specific lines or during idle time. The primary goal is to replicate the slower, more deliberate writing experience of a typewriter.

---

## 2. High-Level Requirements

1. **Slower Text Reveal**  
   - Each character typed by the user is enqueued and displayed after a configurable delay.
   - The delay should be cumulative, so if the user types 3 characters in a row at the same time, they should be displayed one by one with a delay between each character.

2. **Non-destructive Backspace**  
   - Hitting backspace does not remove a character but instead transforms the cursor to a line and moves the cursos back
   - Then, when typing "x" it will “cross out” the next character(s).
   - Multiple backspaces should be able to move back multiple characters, and then typing "x" will cross out a single character
   - Instead of just changing the character to an x, we should use special ascii characters to make it look like the underlying character has been overwritten by x

3. **Progressive Obscuring of Older Text**  
   - The last N lines remain fully visible.
   - Lines exceeding that threshold become gradually obscured, faded, or replaced with placeholders.

4. **Idle Timer**  
   - When the user stops typing for X seconds, the text is covered.
   - Resuming typing uncovers the text.

5. **Traditional Line Breaks**  
   - Pressing Enter inserts a line break without obscuring all prior text.

6. **Formatting Options**  
   - Fixed-width output to simulate standard page width or typewriter alignment.

---

## 3. Use Cases and User Flows

1. **Starting a New Document**  
   - The user launches the application (`typewriter-cli my_document`).
   - The user starts typing; characters appear slowly.

2. **Marking Text**  
   - When the user wants to “delete” text, backspace moves the cursor backward but does not remove text.  
   - That text can be visually highlighted (e.g., with an `x` or color if ANSI is supported).

3. **Reviewing Removed Text**  
   - The user enters a review mode (e.g., pressing a special key or typing a command, such as `:review`).
   - Removed lines or words are displayed in a separate panel or after the main text.

4. **Pausing / Idle Timeout**  
   - If the user is idle for the configured duration, the screen blurs or is replaced by a pause overlay.
   - Typing again dismisses the overlay.

5. **Saving and Exiting**  
   - We are using the same keybindings like nano, so for example ctrl-x will exit and prompt the user to save if there are changes
   - If the user just quits without saving, the application warns and optionally auto-saves.

## 4. System Components

### 4.1 Core Modules

1. **Editor Engine** (`editor.rs`)  
   - Maintains the text buffer (and associated metadata for removed text).  
   - Stores the current cursor position.  
   - Exposes methods for inserting characters, marking text, and performing line breaks.

2. **Rendering Layer** (`renderer.rs`)  
   - Interacts with the terminal to render the text buffer.  
   - Applies obscuring effects for older lines.  
   - Displays removed text in a review mode or separate panel.

3. **Input Handler** (`input.rs`)  
   - Captures keyboard events (using something like `crossterm::event::read`).  
   - Processes these events into commands for the editor engine (insert, mark text, line break, etc.).

4. **Delay/Timer Manager** (`delayer.rs` or similar)  
   - Schedules character insertion based on a delay queue.  
   - Detects idle time and triggers the idle overlay.

5. **Command Parser** (`commands.rs`)  
   - Interprets special commands like `:wq`, `:review`, or other editor actions.

### 4.2 Data Structures

1. **Text Buffer**  
   - A `Vec<Line>` where `Line` is a struct containing text and mark-up state (e.g., normal vs. crossed out).  
   - Each `Line` might be a `Vec<Segment>` if we support different states within a single line.

2. **Removed Text Log**  
   - A separate structure (e.g., `Vec<String>`) capturing removed words or phrases.  
   - Could store each removed entry with a timestamp or line reference for later review.

3. **Character Queue**  
   - A synchronized queue (`VecDeque<QueuedChar>`) that holds characters pending display.  
   - Each `QueuedChar` can have a timestamp indicating when it should be revealed.

4. **Configuration**  
   - Delay per character: `u64` (milliseconds).  
   - Idle timeout: `u64` (seconds).  
   - Lines to keep visible before obscuring: `usize`.  
   - Obscuring method (e.g., `Dim`, `Blur`, `Dots`).

## 5. Functional Specifications

### 5.1 Text Rendering Logic

- **Character Reveal**  
  1. The user presses a key.  
  2. The app enqueues a `QueuedChar` with the typed character and the scheduled reveal time (`Instant::now() + delay`).  
  3. A separate loop checks the queue, and once the reveal time is reached, the character is appended to the text buffer.

- **Backspace Behavior**  
  - Instead of removing the last character, change its state to “marked.”  
  - Optionally store it in `Removed Text Log` if a full word or phrase is “deleted.”  
  - The cursor moves left, but the underlying text remains.
  - Multiple backspaces should be able to move back multiple characters
  - When the cursor is in this mode, typing "x" will cross out the next character(s)

- **Line Breaks**  
  - Pressing Enter inserts `\n`.  
  - The rendering logic starts a new line.  
  - Older lines that fall below the threshold become partially obscured.

### 5.2 Obscuring Mechanism

- **Visibility Threshold**: `N` lines (configurable).  
  - For lines beyond `N`, apply a visual filter (dim color or replace with asterisks, etc.).  
- **Implementation**:  
  - If using ANSI, use a gray or faint color for older lines.  
  - Alternatively, replace characters with a single repeated symbol to indicate obscured text.

### 5.3 Idle Timer Overlay

- **Idle Timeout**:  
  1. Track the last keypress time.  
  2. If no new keypress arrives within `idle_timeout` seconds, draw an overlay or message.  
- **Resume**:  
  - Upon next keypress, remove the overlay and resume normal editing.

### 5.4 Saved States and Commands

- **Commands**  
  - `:wq` → Write buffer to file and quit.  
  - `:q!` → Quit without saving (optional).  
  - `:review` → Toggle view of removed text.  
  - `:help` → Show help text.  

- **File I/O**  
  - The editor can load an existing text file into the buffer.  
  - While editing, writes occur to a temporary file or direct overwriting based on user preference.

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**  
   - Must handle large text buffers without significant delays.  
   - Character queuing and delayed display should not introduce excessive CPU usage.

2. **Robustness**  
   - The editor should not crash or lose data if the user types faster than the reveal rate.  
   - Properly handle terminal resizing if relevant.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
   - Ensure the solution works on Linux, macOS, and Windows terminals.  
   - `crossterm` is a solid choice for multi-platform support.

4. **User Configurability**  
   - Support editing in a `.toml` config file for setting:  
     - Character reveal delay  
     - Idle timeout  
     - Lines to keep unobscured  
     - Obscuring style (dim, blur, replace with `…`)  

---

## 7. CLI and Command Structure

1. **CLI Invocation**  
   - `typewriter-cli [OPTIONS] [FILE]`  
2. **Options**  
   - `-d, --delay <MILLIS>`: Overrides the default character reveal delay.  
   - `-i, --idle-timeout <SECONDS>`: Sets the idle overlay timer.  
   - `-n, --lines-visible <LINES>`: Number of lines to keep unobscured.  
   - `-o, --obscure-method <METHOD>`: `dim` | `asterisks` | `dots`.  
   - `-v, --version`: Shows application version.  
   - `-h, --help`: Displays help.

3. **Commands** (within the app)  
   - `:wq` or `:writequit`  
   - `:review`  
   - `:help`  

---

## 8. Implementation Outline

1. **Initialize Terminal**  
   - Use `crossterm::terminal::enable_raw_mode()` to capture keyboard events.  
   - Hide the cursor if desired for a typewriter-like effect.

2. **Main Event Loop**  
   - Continuously read input events.  
   - Dispatch to the editor engine or command parser.  
   - Render the updated text buffer.

3. **Delayed Character Display**  
   - Spawn a thread that processes the character queue.  
   - For each queued character, wait until its reveal time and then apply it to the buffer.

4. **Idle Timer**  
   - Each time a keypress is registered, reset an `Instant` to track last input.  
   - A background check triggers the overlay if `(current_time - last_input) >= idle_timeout`.

5. **Obscuring Old Lines**  
   - On each render pass, check how many lines from the bottom are fully visible.  
   - For older lines, apply the selected method of obscuring.

6. **Saving**  
   - When `:wq` is called, write the current buffer to the specified file path.  
   - Keep removed text in a separate file or embed it in the main file as an optional feature.

---

## 9. Testing Strategies

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - For the text buffer logic, ensure insertion, line breaks, and marking text behave correctly.  
   - Verify the queue processes characters with the correct delay.

2. **Integration Tests**  
   - Launch a pseudo-terminal session (using something like [PtyProcess](https://crates.io/crates/ptyprocess)) and script keystrokes.  
   - Assert that the rendered output matches expected lines over time.

3. **Stress Tests**  
   - Simulate very rapid typing.  
   - Confirm the queue doesn’t drop characters or render them out of order.

4. **Cross-Platform Checks**  
   - Run on Linux, macOS, Windows.  
   - Verify color rendering and raw mode toggles function consistently.

---

## 10. Potential Enhancements

1. **Rope Data Structure**  
   - For more efficient insertion and deletion in large text buffers.  
   - Could replace `Vec<Line>` with a rope-based library.

2. **Collaboration**  
   - Extend to a networked mode for multiple users typing in one document in real time.

3. **Syntax Highlighting or Theme Support**  
   - Color-coded text based on language syntax, though that might distract from a pure drafting environment.

4. **Plugins or Scripting**  
   - Add a system for hooking into events to apply additional transformations or text expansions automatically.

5. **Automated Summaries of Removed Text**  
   - Provide a summary feature that logs how often words or phrases are marked out.
